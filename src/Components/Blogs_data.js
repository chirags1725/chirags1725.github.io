    desc: "By default, the Python Eel library utilizes the Google Chrome web browser in order to run the application; however, we can also mention the browser with the help of the 'mode' option. Along with 'mode', there are few other application choices available like 'position', 'size', 'geometry', and a lot more, which are passed inside the eel.start() command. To start, Install(as 'pip install eel') and Import eel module(as import eel). Then in the work directry, pass command eel.init(). Then pass command eel.start()",

    Title: "Python Module - Delorean",
    desc: "Delorean is a really cool date/time library. Apart from having a sweet name, it's one of the more natural feeling date/time munging libraries I've used in Python. It's sort of like moment in javascript, except I laugh every time I import it. The docs are also good and in addition to being technically helpful, they also make countless Back to the Future references. Install: pip import delorean. Importing: from delorean import Delorean. Print time as print(Delorean(timezone=EST))",
